Hi, I am Tina. Nice to meet you 

## Abstract



Regeneration
of the endometrial stromal compartment in premenopausal women is
likely maintained by the perivascular endometrial mesenchymal
stem/stromal cells (eMSC) expressing sushi domain containing 2
(SUSD2). The fate of SUSD2 eMSC during pregnancy and their role in
decidualization is not fully known. The aim of our study was to
determine the effect of progesterone on the stemness of the SUSD2+
eMSC isolated from non-pregnant uterine samples.
